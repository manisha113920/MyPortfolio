## Why have a portfolio?
My #rstats friends, can you believe that I got a job interview and possibly an offer because I made this treemap for #TidyTuesday?

## How does this work?
These steps will make a copy of this repository to your own GitHub account and connect it to a web host called Netlify.

Netlify handles most of the hard stuff (such as making html from your text and formatting), so you can concentrate on making content. It does this by using what's called a webpage rendering engine (called Hugo) to transform your text to the HTML web format.

To get started, you can work from the GitHub and Netlify sites directly.
